## Diagram Features

### Color Coding
Each category has a distinct color scheme:
- Blue tones: Fundamentals
- Orange tones: Programming
- Purple tones: Databases
- Green tones: Data Processing
- Yellow tones: Cloud Platforms
- Pink tones: Tools & Technologies
- Teal tones: Best Practices
- Light Purple: Advanced Topics
- Red tones: Certifications

### Structure
- The diagram uses a top-bottom (TB) layout
- Central node: "Data Engineering Roadmap"
- Branches out to main categories
- Each category expands into specific technologies and concepts
- Visual hierarchy helps understand relationships between topics

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Beginners**: Start with Fundamentals and Programming Languages
2. **For Intermediate**: Focus on Databases, Data Processing, and Cloud Platforms
3. **For Advanced**: Explore Best Practices and Advanced Topics
4. **For Career Growth**: Consider relevant Certifications

## Customization

The Mermaid file can be customized to:
- Add new technologies as they emerge
- Adjust the hierarchy based on specific needs
- Change color schemes
- Add or remove categories
- Include learning resource links

## Conversion to Roadmap.sh

This Mermaid diagram can be adapted for Roadmap.sh by:
1. Converting the hierarchical structure to their interactive format
2. Adding skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
3. Including resource links for each topic
4. Adding time estimates for learning
5. Creating interactive clickable nodes

## Maintenance

To keep the roadmap current:
- Review quarterly for new technologies
- Update based on industry trends
- Add emerging tools and frameworks
- Remove deprecated technologies
- Gather feedback from the community
