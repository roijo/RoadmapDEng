## Data Engineering Roadmap

This repository contains a comprehensive roadmap for Data Engineering, created using Mermaid diagram format.

### Mermaid Diagram

The roadmap is defined in `data-engineering-roadmap.mmd` using Mermaid syntax. This file can be:
- Viewed directly on GitHub (GitHub supports Mermaid rendering)
- Converted to various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Integrated into documentation tools
- Adapted for Roadmap.sh style interactive charts

### Roadmap Coverage

The roadmap covers essential Data Engineering topics including:

- **Fundamentals**: Computer Science basics, Networking, Linux, Git
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, Scala, Java
- **Databases & Storage**: Relational, NoSQL, Data Warehouses, Data Lakes
- **Data Processing**: Batch Processing, Stream Processing, ETL/ELT
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Tools & Technologies**: Containerization, Orchestration, Monitoring, Data Quality, BI
- **Best Practices**: Data Modeling, Data Governance, Security, Testing
- **Advanced Topics**: ML Engineering, Real-time Analytics, Data Mesh, Lakehouse Architecture
- **Certifications**: AWS, GCP, Azure, and Databricks certifications

### Viewing the Diagram

#### On GitHub
Simply view the `data-engineering-roadmap.mmd` file on GitHub, and it will render the diagram automatically.

#### Using Mermaid Live Editor
1. Copy the contents of `data-engineering-roadmap.mmd`
2. Paste into [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
3. View and export the diagram

#### Using Mermaid CLI
```bash
# Install Mermaid CLI
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Generate PNG
mmdc -i data-engineering-roadmap.mmd -o roadmap.png

# Generate SVG
mmdc -i data-engineering-roadmap.mmd -o roadmap.svg
```
